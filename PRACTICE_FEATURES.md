# Practice Features & Improvements

## Overview
This document describes all the improvements made to the practice and learning features in AuthorCompanion.

## 🎯 Practice Modes

### 1. **Enhanced Practice Modal** (`PracticeModal.tsx`)
Multiple exercise types to keep learning engaging:

- **Multiple Choice (Choose Synonym)**: Select the correct synonym from 4 options
- **Fill the Blank**: Type the correct word to complete a sentence
- **Define**: Provide a definition or meaning in your own words
- **Spelling**: Spell out the word based on its definition

**Features:**
- Immediate feedback (correct/incorrect with explanation)
- Pronunciation button (Web Speech API)
- Auto-progress after submission
- Practice scoring and attempt tracking
- Works completely offline with cached data

### 2. **Flashcard Practice** (`FlashcardPractice.tsx`)
Interactive flashcard system with multiple modes:

#### Flip Mode
- Classic flashcard behavior
- Click/tap to reveal definition
- Shows synonyms on the back
- Progress tracking

#### Guess Mode
- See the definition
- Type the word you think it is
- Immediate feedback
- Category hints

**Features:**
- Dual-mode switching (Flip ↔ Guess)
- 10-word practice sessions
- Progress bar
- Statistics dashboard (Correct/Incorrect/Skipped)
- "Again" button to restart session
- Pronunciation support
- Smooth transitions and animations

## 📊 Performance Metrics

All practice data is tracked and stored locally:

```
- Total Attempts
- Correct Count
- Accuracy Percentage
- Time Spent Per Word
- Attempts Per Word
- Success Rate Trend
```

## 💾 Data Storage

Practice data uses localStorage API:
- Each practice attempt is stored with timestamp
- Last 100 attempts kept per word
- Practice scores calculated using spaced repetition algorithm
- All data available offline

## 🔄 Spaced Repetition Integration

Practice results feed into the spaced repetition system:
- Quality scores (1-5 scale)
- Time tracking for performance analysis
- Automatic difficulty adjustment
- Review scheduling based on mastery

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Smooth Animations**: Transitions between cards
- **Clear Feedback**: Visual indicators for correct/incorrect
- **Progress Visibility**: Always show where user is in practice session
- **Mode Indicators**: Visual badges showing exercise type

## 🚀 GitHub Actions Integration

### Automated Builds
File: `.github/workflows/build.yml`

**Triggers:**
- Push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests to main/develop

**Jobs:**
1. **build-web**: Vite production build
2. **build-ios**: iOS app build (macOS runner)
3. **build-android**: Android APK build (Ubuntu runner)
4. **test**: TypeScript type checking
5. **notify**: Build status report

### Capacitor Build Script
File: `scripts/build-capacitor.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Build all platforms
./scripts/build-capacitor.sh all

# Build specific platform
./scripts/build-capacitor.sh web
./scripts/build-capacitor.sh ios
./scripts/build-capacitor.sh android
```

**What it does:**
- Installs dependencies
- Builds web app
- Sets up Capacitor for each platform
- Syncs changes
- Builds platform-specific binaries

## 📱 Capacitor Configuration

File: `frontend/capacitor.config.ts`

```typescript
- App ID: com.authorcompanion.app
- App Name: Author Vocabulary Companion
- Web Directory: dist
- Supported Plugins: PushNotifications, SplashScreen
- Android Scheme: https
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Practice Modal not showing?
- Check that words are saved in vocabulary
- Verify localStorage is enabled
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Flashcard audio not working?
- Check browser supports Web Speech API
- Grant microphone permissions if needed
- Try on latest Chrome, Safari, or Edge

### GitHub Actions failing?
- Check Node.js version compatibility
- Verify Android SDK is installed
- Ensure Xcode is up to date (for iOS builds)
- Check for Java/Gradle compatibility

## 📚 API Integration

Practice features use:
- `dictionaryApi.getWord()` - Fetch word definitions
- `localStorageApi.addPracticeAttempt()` - Record attempts
- `localStorageApi.updatePracticeScore()` - Update scores
- `spacedRepetitionService` - Schedule reviews

All data flows through the 3-layer system:
1. Cache (localStorage)
2. Offline dictionary
3. Online API (fallback)
